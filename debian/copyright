 This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
 The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest. This code was
 written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
 This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
 .
 Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc. 
 This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
 except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
 with every copy.
 .
 Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h' header
 definitions; now uses stuff from dpkg's config.h.
 - Ian Jackson <ian@chiark.greenend.org.uk>.
 Still in the public domain.
