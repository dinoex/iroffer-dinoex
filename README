 --- What is iroffer? ---

iroffer is a software program that acts as a fileserver for IRC.
It is similar to a FTP server or WEB server, but users can download
files using the DCC protocol of IRC instead of a web browser.

iroffer is a standalone executable written entirely in C.
Designed for speed and efficency, iroffer can transfer over 95MByte/sec
over a gigabit ethernet connection.

See the file "README.modDinoex" for changelog and features.
